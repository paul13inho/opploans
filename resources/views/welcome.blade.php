                <h3>What is an online personal loan?</h3>
                <p>Online personal loans are unsecured installment loans offered by online lenders and some traditional banks. Broadly, online credit products may take the form of a line of credit, a cash advance, or other loan options.

                    Online personal loan offers should clearly disclose the loan's APR (annual percentage rate), the term, and any fees such as finance charges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How are OppLoans online personal loans different?</h3>
                <p>We truly care about our customers and work hard to be flexible for each of our customer's unique situations. We want to make sure borrowers get the best loan for them, whether it's with OppLoans or a different online lender.

                    Unlike some financial institutions (and quite unlike payday loans5), OppLoans charges no origination fees or prepayment penalties. Our loans charge simple, fixed rate interest and contain no hidden fees.

                    OppLoans doesn't base funding decisions exclusively on FICO credit scores or credit history.

                    We also report payments to all three major credit bureaus to help borrowers build their credit history.6

                    And if you opt into our "Turn Up Program", we'll proactively see if your loan application would qualify you for a loan at a cheaper interest rate with one of our lending partners.</p>

                <h3>What are the eligibility requirements to apply for an online personal loan?</h3>
                <p>The first step in applying for a loan through OppLoans is to fill out our online loan application. To be eligible for a lending product through OppLoans, potential borrowers must:

                    Be 18 years or older
                    Have a bank account (checking account or saving account)
                    Reside in one of the states in which we currently operate
                    Have a regular source of income (Income can be from employment or from benefits including Social Security, Disability, etc. Please note: alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income is optional to include)
                    Receive income through direct deposit</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What can you use an online personal loan for?</h3>
                <p>Online personal loans can be used for a wide variety of purposes. Maybe you're looking for a loan to help consolidate debt from multiple credit cards, or maybe you need to fund an expensive home improvement or car repair. Also, if you're looking to turn bad credit into good credit, the right online personal loan may help you do that.

                    OppLoans customers have used their loan amounts for:

                    Car repair loans
                    Home repair loans
                    Debt consolidation loans
                    Loans to help pay off medical debt
                    Whatever your reason for searching online lenders (and whether you have excellent credit, bad credit, or you land somewhere in the middle), there are terms and conditions of the loan that you'll want to understand. Borrowers should always be clear on the interest rate, repayment terms, and whether or not the lender will run a hard or soft credit check.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How much can I apply for?</h3>
                <p>Consumer products offered through the OppLoans website range from $500 to $4,000, but your eligibility will depend on your state of residence, your income and ability to repay, and your creditworthiness. For more information about the product options and lender(s) in your state, please visit our
                    <a href="#">Rates and Terms page</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How does repayment of a personal loan work?</h3>
                <p>OppLoans believes in matching borrowers with the best possible loan for them. If we're able to provide you with an online personal loan product, we want to make sure your repayment options are both clear and affordable across the life of the loan term.

                    OppLoans offers multiple recurring payment options including ACH and paper check options. For single payments, debit cards are also accepted.</p>

            NV Residents: The use of high-interest loans services should be used for short-term financial needs only and not as a long-term financial solution. Customers with credit difficulties should seek credit counseling before entering into any loan transaction.

            1Subject to credit approval and verification. Actual approved loan amount and terms are dependent on standard underwriting guidelines and credit policies. Funds are typically deposited via ACH for delivery for next business day if verification is completed and final approval occurs before 8:00 PM CT, Monday-Friday. Availability of the funds is dependent on how quickly your bank processes the transaction.

            2OppLoans may use credit report information provided by Clarity Services and Experian as part of the application process to determine your creditworthiness. Neither credit inquiry will appear as a hard credit inquiry on your Experian credit report and therefore they will not affect your FICO score.

            4Installment loan amounts typically range from $500 to $4,000. APR ranges from 59% to 160%. Installment loan lengths range from 9 to 18 months. Example: A $2,000 installment loan repayable in 9 monthly payments would have an APR of 160% and monthly payments of $394.58. <a href=""#>Rates and terms vary by state</a>. This is an expensive form of credit and you should determine whether our product(s) meets your financial needs.

            5According to the Consumer Federation America, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, payday loans range in size from $100 to $1,000, depending on state legal maximums, and carry an average annual percentage rate (APR) of 400%. The maximum APR for a loan offered through and serviced by OppLoans is 160% and loan sizes range from $500 to $4,000. <a href=""#>https://paydayloaninfo.org/how-payday-loans-work/</a>.

            6OppLoans reports customer payment history to the three major credit bureaus. On-time payments may improve credit score.

We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.
